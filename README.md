# [The Final Project!](https://youtu.be/9jK-NcRmVcw?si=fGir5XVa75Ls37om)

This repo is for the current complete reference implementation of AniGraph. It runs both C1 scenes, which are 2D and final project scenes.  
## For the staff:
You can choose which application to run by commenting/uncommenting the appropriate lines in [./src/MainApp.tsx](./src/MainApp.tsx).
